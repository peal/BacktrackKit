# Filters a partition stack by a graph, a single step
# The graph should be in the following format:
# graph[i] is the neighbours of vertex i.
# A neighbour should be a list [colour, neighbour],
# where neighbour is another vertex and colour is the 'colour' of the edge.
# For undirected graphs be sure to put the edge in, in both directions.
# For directed graphs, make the 'colour' of the edge in both directions different
# (for example 1 in the forward direction, -1 in the backward direction)
